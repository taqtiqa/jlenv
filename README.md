Use jlenv to pick a Julia version for your application and guarantee
that your development environment matches production.

 Further [documentation is here](https://jlenv.github.io/jlenv/).

**Powerful in development.** Specify your app's Julia version once,
  in a single file. Keep all your teammates on the same page. No
  headaches running apps on different versions of Julia. Just Works™
  from the command line and with app servers like [Pow](http://pow.cx).
  Override the Julia version anytime: just set an environment variable.

**Rock-solid in production.** Your application's executables are its
  interface with ops. The Julia version
  dependency lives in one place—your app—so upgrades and rollbacks are
  atomic, even when you switch versions.

**One thing well.** [jlenv]((https://github.com/jlenv/jlenv) is concerned solely with switching Julia
  versions. It's simple and predictable. A rich plugin ecosystem lets
  you tailor it to suit your needs. Compile your own Julia versions, or
  use the [julia-build](https://github.com/jlenv/julia-build)
  plugin to automate the process.
  See more [plugins in the documentation](https://jlenv.github.io/jlenv/plugins).
