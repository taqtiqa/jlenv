# Why jlenv?

### [](#jlenv-does)jlenv does…_

*   Support specifying **application-specific Julia versions** with `.julia-version` file.
*   Let you **change the global Julia version** on a per-user basis.
*   Allow you to **override the Julia version** with an environment variable.

### [](#jlenv-does-not)Jlenv _does not…_

*   **Need to be loaded into your shell.** Instead, jlenv's shim approach works by adding a directory to your `$PATH`.
*   **Override shell commands like `cd` or require prompt hacks.** That's dangerous and error-prone.
*   **Have a configuration file.** There's nothing to configure except which version of Julia you want to use.
*   **Install Julia.** You can build and install Julia yourself, or use [julia-build](https://github.com/jlenv/julia-build) to automate the process.
*   **Manage Packages.** [Pkg](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/stable/managing-packages/) is a better way to manage application dependencies. 
*   **Require changes to Julia libraries for compatibility.** The simplicity of jlenv means as long as it's in your `$PATH`, [nothing](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/handling-multiple-versions-of-julia/14035) [else](http://modules.sourceforge.net/) needs to know about it.
