See [Authoring Plugins](/jlenv/authoring-plugins.md) for instructions on how to write
new commands for jlenv or hook into its functionality.

A plugin can be installed by dropping it in as a sub-directory of
`$JLENV_ROOT/plugins`, or it can be located elsewhere on the system as long as
`jlenv-*` executables are placed in the `$PATH` and hooks are installed
accordingly somewhere in `$JLENV_HOOK_PATH`.

## Approved plugins(#approved-plugins)

These plugins are maintained in the jlenv organisation.  They aim to be
compatible with jlenv.  Eventually these may be incorporated into jlenv.
